# Install MDict on Android

Android users are recommended to use the [DictTango](install_android_dicttango.md) app rather than MDict. It offers a much better user experience and has many more advanced options.

If you would still prefer to use MDict, here's how to get it setup.  

## In Brief

1. download the latest MDict version of DPD from [Github](https://github.com/digitalpalidictionary/digitalpalidictionary/releases)
2. download and install MDict from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.mdict&hl=en&gl=US) or the [MDict website](https://www.mdict.cn/wp/?page_id=5325&lang=en) 
3. copy DPD to the MDict folder

Below are detailed *step-by-step* instructions. 

## Download DPD

First things first, download the latest MDict version of Digital Pāḷi Dictionary from [Github](https://github.com/digitalpalidictionary/digitalpalidictionary/releases)

## Download MDict

Download and install MDict from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.mdict&hl=en&gl=US) OR from the [MDict website](https://www.mdict.cn/wp/?page_id=5325&lang=en)

## Copy the dpd file to the MDict Folder

Using any file manager, make an **MDict/doc** folder on your SD card. \
(That's a folder called **MDict** and a subfolder called **doc**.)

**Copy** dpd.mdx file into the **MDict/doc** folder.

## Setup MDict

You should get this splash screen the first time you run MDict

Open the **Library**.

Check that **DPD** is the library.

Select **Groups > All**. This is important if you want to see **all definitions** of a word.

Open **Settings**.

Click on **Lookup**.

Ensure **Global Clipboard Monitor** is turned on. This allows anything copied to the clipboard to be opened in MDict.

Hold down any Pāḷi word in any text to **select** it, clicking **copy** opens it in MDict.

## DPR Settings

As an added bonus, if you use Digital Pāli Reader, open **Settings** and turn on **Copy words to clipboard on click**. Now simply clicking on any word should open it in MDict.
