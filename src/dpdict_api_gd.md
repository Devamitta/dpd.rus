## Setup API in GoldenDict

Here's how to setup DPD as a live searchable website in GoldenDict. This has the advantage of always being up-to-date with the latest DPD database, and the disadvantage of being slightly slower. 

Open Menu > Edit > Dictionaries (Shortcut F3)

![open dictionaries](pics/www.dpdict.net/dpdict_api_gd_open_dictionaries.png)

(1) In **Sources**, go to the **Websites** tab

![add website](pics/www.dpdict.net/dpdict_api_gd_add_website.png)

(2) Click **Add**

(3) Add the following information

Enable: checked\
As Link: unchecked\
Name: www.dpdict.net\
Address: https://dpdict.net/gd?search=%GDWORD%

(1) Go to the **Dictionaries** tab

![reorder dictionaries](pics/www.dpdict.net/dpdict_api_gd_reorder_dictionaries.png)

(2) Drag www.dpdict.net to the position where you want it displayed

That's it, you're all set up!
