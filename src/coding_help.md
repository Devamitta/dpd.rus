# Help with Coding

I am seeking help to code various aspects of the Digital Pāḷi Dictionary project. If you have the expertise and the interest, [please get in touch by email](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com).

## Python

I am always in need of help from experienced Python programmers, with small and medium sized tasks, as well as code reviews and consultation. 

## Flutter

As part of a longer-term vision, I would like to develop DPD into a Flutter App. This app would replicate the current lookup functionality of GoldenDict and further allow the integration of many requested features, which are not possible within the GoldenDict framework. The backend would be a SQLite database, with methods to lookup and present the relevant data. This is a longer, more complex project.
